While it can fade if properly contained, it can spread and break things around it very easily. Touching it in any way will give you Taint Poison, and letting it spread will just make cleanup worse."

Any armor will protect the wearer from harm, but will be heavily damaged by the effects. Similar to normal poison, it will not kill a player outright, but will keep them at minimal health."

Do not let it touch a liquid, though fire can help a lot to keep it at bay."
